# 481_Project
The data used is from Yelp's Open Dataset. It was used to collect restaurant reviews for training.
restaurant_reviews_filtered.csv is a csv file from a hundred random restaurants and their reviews to be used for training and testing.
To run this project simply run 481.py
481.py uses either Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes to classify a review as either positive or negative.
